# Hi there, I'm Zijad ðŸ‘‹

<p> I'm a graduate student of Polytechnic faculty in Zenica, department of Software Engineering, which enabled me to understand advanced concepts of programming and everything else that is necessary for a good start in the Information Technology sector. I have a desire to become professional backend developer.</p>
